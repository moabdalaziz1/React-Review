- This is a React project that helped me review some of React features and libraries and also some Tailwind.css.
- some of the things that I reviewed in the project:
  1. setting up the project with Vite
  2. setting up Tailwind.css
  3. The folder structure in this project should be a reference for me to implement the best folder structure in any project I did.
  4. I used the react-icons library.
  5. I used the react-spinners library that make the page loading with cool while executing the data from the server (cool library).
  6. I used the react-toastify library which provides a pop-up or a notification after an action is successful or fails (cool library).
  7. I used the react-dom-router library which produces important features and makes react make multi-page websites nice and smooth (it should be studied more because it is an important library that I will need).
  8. Also learned how to make the main layout.
  9. json-server library which makes my local data.json file a local server that I can fetch the data from, so I can use the (useState, useEffect) hook.
  10. How to use the proxy in vite.config.js file (Must read more on how to use a proxy).
  11. Implement the CRUD method in the project.
