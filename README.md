- This is a React project that helped me in review some of react features and library and also some Tailwind.css.
- some of things that I reviewed in the project:
  1. setting up the project with vite
  2. setting up Tailwind.css
  3. The folder structure in this project should be a reference for me to implement the best folder structure in any project I did.
  4. I used react-icons library.
  5. I used react-spinners library that make the page loading with cool while executing the data from the server (cool library).
  6. I used react-toastify library which provide a pop-up or a notification after an action is success or fail (cool library).
  7. I used react-dom-router library which produce important features and make react make multipages websites nice and smoothly (should be studied more because it important library that I will need).
  8. Also learned how to make the main layout.
  9. json-server library which make my local data.json file a local server that I can fetch the data from it so I can use (useState, useEffect) hook.
  10. How to use proxy (Must read more on how to use proxy).
  11. Implement the CRUD method in the project.
